# Extend BookApiService

In order to send the book to our Backend we need to extend our BookApiService for another Request.

- Extend the BookApiService with a create method
- The method create should take a book (Book) as a parameter and send it with a POST request.
- Inject the service inside of the BookNewComponent
- Extract the form data from the FormGroup (you can use the getRawValue-Function from the FormGroup for this)
- Call the create method from the BookApiService and give in the extracted form data

## Hints

  return this.http.post<Book>('http://localhost:4730/books', book)
}
```

```ts
// book-new.component.ts
private bookApiService = inject(BookApiService)
...
submit() {
  this.bookApiService.create(this.form.getRawValue() as Book).subscribe()
}
```

# BookNewForm

- Create a new Component BookNewComponent for the Book-Feature with ng generate component book/book-new
- Configure a new Route inside the book.routes.ts File, displaying the BookNewComponent (path: new)
- Add a link from BookComponent with routerLink to the new route.
- Add ReactiveFormsModule to the imports-Array of the BookNewComponent
- Inside the book-new.component.ts-File:
    - inject the FormBuilder from @angular/forms
    - Create a FormGroup by calling the group-Function on the injected FormBuilder
    - The formGroup should have Controls for isbn,author,title,subtitle, andabstract
- Inside the book-new.component.html-File:
    - Add a <form>-Tag and bind the created form Property to the [formGroup]-Directive
    - For each created Control inside the FormGroup create one <input>-Tag and bind the FormControl-Keys to the formControlName-Directive
    - Also add a Submit-Button with type=submit
    - In order to get notified if the user clicks on this button need to register to the (ngSubmit)-Event inside the <form>-Tag and bind it to a submit()-function
    - you need to implement this function as well inside the book-new.component.ts-File. Inside this function you can just log the form on the console

Run the application inside the Browser: You should see your form. After you filled it out and clicked on the Submit-Button you should see the whole FormGroup-Object inside your Browser Developer Console.

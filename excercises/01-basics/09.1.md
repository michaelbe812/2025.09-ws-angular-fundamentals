# Pipes / BookFilterPipe

## The Book filter pipe

- Create a pipe using the CLI: ng generate pipe book-filter/book-filter.
- Open src/app/book-filter/book-filter.pipe.ts.
- Enhance the transform method of the pipe to filter books by title.

## The Book filter control

- Switch to src/app/app.component.html
- Add an <input>-Field acting as search field.
- Handle its (input)-Event by binding it to a method called updateBookSearchTerm($event).
- Implement the method updateBookSearchTerm in app.component.ts.
- Extract the value of the input field from the Event and store the search term in a property called bookSearchTerm.

## Use the bookFilter-Pipe

- Open app.component.ts.
- Add BookFilterPipe to imports array.
- Open app.component.html.
- Enhance the @for-expression by using the bookFilter-Pipe.
- Pass the value of the <input>-Field to the pipe by adding the parameter bookSearchTerm

## Check the result

- Open the browser at localhost:4200
- Check if the filter works as exepected

<!-- app.component html -->


<!-- search input -->

<input (input)="updateBookSearchTerm($event)">

<!--  use pipe -->

@for(book of books | bookFilter: bookSearchTerm; track book.title){
<app-book-card ...>
```

```ts
// app.component.ts

// store input value in property
updateBookSearchTerm(input: Event) {
  this.bookSearchTerm = (input.target as HTMLInputElement).value;
  //                                  ^ tells the TypeScript-Compiler to treat the target property as HTMLInputElement
}
```

# Async Pipe

- Store the getAll()-Observable in a class property
- Import the AsyncPipe into your BookComponent imports array
- Use the Observable and async pipe to subscribe and unsubscribe inside your @for
- Warning: This change affects the typing in the template
    - async returns either Book[] or null
    - You may need to adjust BookFilterPipe to deal with null-Values.
- Now, you can remove all code dealing with subscribing or unsubscribing from the Observable.
    - This should save a couple lines of code.

# Restructure Project

- Create a component that will take all the code of AppComponent: ng generate component book/book.
- Move all book related code to the book/-folder.
    - book.ts
    - book-card/
    - book-filter/
- Open app.component.ts.
    - -- Remove all book related code.
    - -- Move BookCardComponent & BookFilterPipe from imports array in app.component.ts to imports array in book.component.ts
    - -- Add BookComponent to the imports array of app.component.ts.
    - -- Transfer all properties and methods of AppComponent to BookComponent.
- Transfer the content of app.component.html to book.component.html.
- Transfer the content of app.component.scss to book.component.scss.
- Open app.component.html
- Add <app-book></app-book> to the template.
- Check if all imports-statements are correct.


**Often the import-Statements are updated automatically by your editor, but sometimes the end result is not perfect. If you experience that your app does not compile, check & correct the import-Statements.**

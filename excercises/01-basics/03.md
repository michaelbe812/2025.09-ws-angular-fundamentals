# First Component

Open a second terminal.

Switch to the directory where your Angular project is located.

Create a new component by executing the following command ng generate component book-card.

Recognize that three files are generated.

Recognize that your component (book-card.component.ts) has the selector app-book-card.

Open src/app/book-card/book-card.component.html.

Set up a simple HTML template visualizing book-information by using static data.

    title
    author
    details-link
    abstract

```html
<!-- book-card.component.html -->


<h3>Moby Dick</h3>
<h4>Herman Melville</h4>  

<!--... link, abstract ...-->
```

Use your component in app.component.html. Replace the existing content of app.component.html with <app-book-card></app-book-card>.

Add the missing import for BookCardComponent to imports in app.component.ts.

Ensure that your component is displayed in the browser.

Check localhost:4200.

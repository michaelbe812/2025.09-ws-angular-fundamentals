# Use a Signal instead of Observable

- Open book.component.ts and rename books$ to books
- Make use of the toSignal() function in order to create a Signal out of the observable returned by the BookAPI service
- Change type of books accordingly
- Refactor the template of BookComponent, so that it can use the signal


## Hints
- The type of the Signal needs to be: books: Signal<Book[] | undefined>;
- Usage of toSignal(): this.books = toSignal(this.bookApi.getAll()); and move this line into the constructor!
- If you get an error in the browsser toSignal() can only be used inside of an injection context see hint above (move line into the constructor)
- Usage of signal in template: @for(book of books() | bookFilter: bookSearchTerm;...
- Since books() can be undefined, it might be necessary to refactor bookFilter pipe in order to accept undefined: transform(books: Book[] | null | undefined, searchTerm: string | null): Book[] {

**Solution Tag**: solve--use-a-signal

## ⭐️ Bonus 
Only if you are already a bit familiar with signals
- Create an `effect` that uses the books Signal and prints out the number of books loaded

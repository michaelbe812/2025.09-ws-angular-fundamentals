# Inspect AppComponent


Let's warm up a bit and get familiar with our project environment.

- Open a terminal
- Switch into the directory, where your Angular project is located
- Run the Angular project by executing the command npm start -- --open
- Open your Angular project in your preferred editor (VS Code, WebStorm, Sublime, ...)
- Open the file src/app/app.component.ts.
- Change the value of the property title.
- Recognize that each change in a file causes an automatic reload in the browser
